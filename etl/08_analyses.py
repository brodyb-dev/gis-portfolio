"""08 - Run the analyses in db/analysis/ and write docs/analysis-results.md.

The SQL files run in name order and each replaces its own tables in the `analysis` schema:

  02_building_density   analysis.hex_buildings     (analysis 1)

  04_transit_access     analysis.building_transit, hex_transit, transit_access_summary (2)
  05_isochrones         analysis.isochrones(lon, lat, mode, minutes[]) for the API (3)
  06_flood_exposure     analysis.flood_* and flood_summary (5)

Exits with status 1 if a check fails, such as an empty result or a 15-minute walk isochrone
slower than 3 seconds (acceptance criterion 5).
