-- 06 - Flood exposure of buildings, roads and transit (analysis 5).
--
-- FEMA's 100-yr (1% annual chance) and 500-yr (0.2%) zones don't overlap, so "500-yr exposure"
-- means 100-yr + 500-yr together (see analysis.flood_summary). `levee` is Zone X behind a
-- levee, reported separately.
--   Buildings  a footprint touching a zone counts as exposed. A building touching more than
--              one class takes the highest-risk one.
--   Roads      street edges cut to the zones, in miles. "Streets" match analysis 4: drivable
--              edges except highway=service (driveways, parking aisles, alleys), which made up
--              half or more of the flooded mileage and would mostly count private pavement.
--              Bridges are left out: they span the floodplain (the river crossings sit over
--              100-yr polygons) but are elevated.
--   Transit    stops inside a zone, and route miles inside a zone.
